excerpt: 'We define a block-by-block version of Isaacs and Navarro’s chain local condition and then prove that the Alperin–McKay conjecture is equivalent to a certain function on groups having this property. We then go on to prove several other block-by-block versions of results from Isaacs and Navarro’s paper.'
